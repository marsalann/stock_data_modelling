# Stock price data modelling

This is a part of a time series data modelling project to assess and understand usage of different Machine Learning and deep learning architectures in modelling and predicting stock data.

After basic visualization and pre=processing, A simple feed forward neural network is applied on different stock price paradigms, followed by RNN and then LSTM. 
At the end, their effectiveness is compared.
